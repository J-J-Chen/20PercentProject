# Proposal: [Triva fun]
## [The new trivia crack]
[John Chen] 

## Needs and Opportunities
Nowadays, people are playing a lot of video games. These video games don't help them learn.
I'm going to fix that with my project. My 20% project will make a "video game" that will help people learn.

## Audience / Clients / Users
Anyone from ages 10 and up will be able to benifit from my project.
I will be able to access them using the power of the internet. I will post the project online so anyone who has
an internet access can use it.

## Product
When spring time comes, I will be presenting a trivia game. 
The game will be capable of saving your progress and will have a multiplayer function.

## Timeline

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Lean basics of QT |
| April 1       | Create a skeleton of the project |
| April 29      | Have single player working |

## Reality Check
I'm going to need a computer and internet.

## Conclusion
I want to help making learning fun. With this video game, children will be excited to learn about the world around them.
Once children know more about the world, the world will be a better place.
