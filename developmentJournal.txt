Today I set up my development environment. I started to install Microsoft Visual studios, but it didn't finish because the download speed was slow. I started to research what C++ libraries I should use. I'm looking into SDL and using eclipse, but I'm not sure right now. I'm also thinking of using QT, but I'm having problems with some errors. I have tried to look online for solutions, but I couldn't figure it out. QT is also notorius for having a very messy UI, which sort of deviates from the standard c++ style. Some of the example projects won't compile, and I don't know how to fix the errors. So, I probably won't be using QT. So all I did today was research what development  environment I should use for my C++ program. Latter today, I will start to watch tutorials on how to create a GUI for whatever program I decide to use.

Today I started to watch tutorials on the basics of C++. I learned the differences between the header files and the source files. The syntax is somewhat different than Java's, but both programming languages share a lot of similiarities. Both languages have ints, floats, etc. However, in C++ you have to worry about pointers. In C++ there is pass by reference and pass by value. Passing by value makes a copy of the variable and does work on the coppied variable. This means that the original variable won't get changed. Passing by reference means that you pass a pointer. The pointer is just the adress to the variable. This is more effiecient, and the original variable will get changed. In java, you don't have to worry about any of this. This makes Java sort of nice, but it also makes it kind of annoying. C++ allows more control over the program, but is more explicite and thus more difficult to master.

Today I installed SDL into eclipse. I have started to watch videos and look though the SDL documentation. SDL isn't too hard to use, and it's mostly intuitive. It still follows the syntax of c++, but has more funcionality. and can actually do graphical stuff. At first, I had problems including the library, but I was able to fix it. Eclipse was saying that there was nothing to build, even though I had a .cpp. Turns out mingw isn't the best compiler, but is commonly used with SDL. Once I switched my compiler and set it up with cygwin, it worked perfectly. I have also started to draw out my whole program on paper. I have drawn out all the buttons, spinners, and pictures. Tomorrow I will start to find all the pictures and create my main class. I will continue to watch more tutorials to learn the basics of SDL and C++.

Today I worked on adding basic pictures to my trivia game. I have just started to make the basic layout of the main menu. Right now, I'm considering how I should store the game data. I want to have some type of virtual currency, and I have to look into the different ways to do that. I'm actually sort of familiar with YAML, but xml would be better since it is harder to cheat. But, I don't know how to use xml, so I'll have to see. Next week I'm planning to add my questions for the trivia part of the game, so I'll need to start looking up how to use a file reader in C++. I am having troubles with adding/commiting my files. Whenever I try to track my Microsoft Visual Sudio files, git says that it cannot read the files it doesn't have permission. I have tried changing the project folder from read only to allow writing, but it always changes back.
