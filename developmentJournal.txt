Today I set up my development environment. I started to install Microsoft Visual studios, but it didn't finish because the download speed was slow. I started to research what C++ libraries I should use. I'm looking into SDL and using eclipse, but I'm not sure right now. I'm also thinking of using QT, but I'm having problems with some errors. I have tried to look online for solutions, but I couldn't figure it out. QT is also notorius for having a very messy UI, which sort of deviates from the standard c++ style. Some of the example projects won't compile, and I don't know how to fix the errors. So, I probably won't be using QT. So all I did today was research what development  environment I should use for my C++ program. Latter today, I will start to watch tutorials on how to create a GUI for whatever program I decide to use.
